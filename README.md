## About:
- This program uses an incremental algorithm, as would be done for a Delaunay
  triangulation, but skipping the edge flips.
- Some GPU support provided - checking which triangle contains the point to
  be added is implemented in parallel.
- Also includes a random coordinates generator and a small plotting script

### WARNINGS! When running on GPU...
- The GPU part has A LOT of precision problems that I'm tryin to fix. 
  If you want to use it, do so at your own risk (for now!)
- Some drivers may present some problems of not detecting your GPU device.
  If this happens, try running the program as root.

## Requirements:
- Python 2.7 or higher
- OpenCL 1.2
- pyOpenCL bindings
- All the necessary drivers and support for your specific GPU

## Running:
- To run the points generator:

        python pointsGen.py n_of_points low_limit high_limit

- To run the triangulations:
        python triangulate.py [OPTION] input_coordinates_file
	
	OPTIONS: 
	
		-C: run on CPU 
		-G: run on GPU
		none: will run BOTH!

- To plot:
	    python plot.py
